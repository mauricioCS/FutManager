# FutManager
This is the final project of the Objects Oriented Programming subject from University of SÃ£o Paulo.
In this project we used the concepts of O.O.P. to create a game very similar to Brasfoot, a game in which can be the manager of a football team.

*We have no connection with Brasfoot and his developers (http://www.brasfoot.com/).*

# Execution
